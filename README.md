# Password-Generator
# Description
This application generates a random, secure password based on user-selected criteria. This application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It also features a clean and responsive UI, ensuring adaptation to multiple screen sizes.

# Installation
The "generate password" function is executed when the button is clicked on the website.

Through JavaScript, the user is presented with a series of prompts to determine password criteria, specifically password lenth (between 8 to 128 characters) and password character types (numerical, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters). The user's input is validated using if else statements (e.g., filtering out irrelevant inputs like 'pizza'). When all prompts are answered appropriately, a random password that matches user's criteria is generated and displayed on the screen.
